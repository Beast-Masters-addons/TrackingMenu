# TrackingMenu
In WoW Classic the hunters tracking is placed as spells in the spell book and there is no real tracking menu.

This addon creates minimap button with a menu similar to the tracking menu in modern WoW where you can select the tracking you want.

This is inspired by Fizzwidget TrackMenu, but since the old code used a 3rd party menu library (Dewdrop) which is no longer maintained, this addon is written from scratch with Blizzard UIDropDownMenu API, which is the same API used the built-in menu in modern WoW.
