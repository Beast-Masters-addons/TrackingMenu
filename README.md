# TrackingMenu
WoW Classic has no townsfolk tracking, but hunters and some professions have trackings as spells in the spellbook, and there is no real tracking menu.

This addon creates a minimap button with a menu similar to the tracking menu in modern WoW where you can select the tracking you want.

It is similar to Fizzwidget TrackMenu, but since the old code used a 3rd party menu library (Dewdrop) which is no longer maintained, this is a new addon made from scratch.
The menu uses Blizzard UIDropDownMenu API, which is the same API used the built-in menu in modern WoW.
